# Build and run the materials-bridge pending-sweep consumer regression.
#
# D-26: a materials command whose transport ack arrived but whose receipt was
# lost held its pending lock forever because the receipt sweep only ran
# inside `sync-from-db!`.  This harness drives the real bridge against a
# headless Fulcro app and proves:
#   - the sweep queries receipts without a sync event;
#   - the gateway's `:not-found` answer releases the pending lock;
#   - the transport-level `:submitted` ack does not release it early.
#
# This is a focused Node harness; the production build is shadow-cljs :app.
# All foreign libs live under test/js.  Never point one at node_modules:
# Closure compiles the package's package.json as JavaScript into the output
# tree, and Node then fails with ERR_INVALID_PACKAGE_CONFIG.
